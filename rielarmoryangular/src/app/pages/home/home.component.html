            <h1>The Four Primary Rules of Gun Safety</h1>
            <p>
                The Four Primary Rules of Gun Safety form the cornerstone of 
                responsible firearm ownership. Every individual who handles a 
                firearm bears the obligation to internalize these principles 
                and apply them without exception. They serve as the foundation 
                for preventing negligent discharges, avoiding tragic accidents, 
                and maintaining the integrity of both the shooter and the 
                shooting community. By embracing these rules as habitual practice 
                rather than temporary caution, firearm owners uphold not only their 
                own safety but also the safety and confidence of everyone who 
                shares their environment.
