        <h1>The Four Primary Rules of Gun Safety</h1>
        <h2>
            The Four Primary Rules of Gun Safety form the cornerstone of 
            responsible firearm ownership. Every individual who handles a 
            firearm bears the obligation to internalize these principles 
            and apply them without exception. They serve as the foundation 
            for preventing negligent discharges, avoiding tragic accidents, 
            and maintaining the integrity of both the shooter and the 
            shooting community. By embracing these rules as habitual practice 
            rather than temporary caution, firearm owners uphold not only their 
            own safety but also the safety and confidence of everyone who 
            shares their environment.
