        <p>
            The Licenses and Permits section explains the various types 
            of firearm licenses and permits required in the Philippines. 
            Understanding these requirements is crucial for legal 
            ownership, safe handling, and compliance with national 
            regulations. This section will guide you through the necessary 
            documentation, eligibility criteria, and processes to ensure 
            responsible and lawful possession of firearms.
