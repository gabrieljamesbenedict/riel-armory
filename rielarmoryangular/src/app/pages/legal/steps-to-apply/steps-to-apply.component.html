            <h1>Step 1: Verify Eligibility</h1>
            <p>
                Before applying for a firearms license, ensure that you 
                meet all legal requirements under RA 10591. Applicants must 
                be at least 21 years old, of sound mind, and free from criminal 
                records. Additional requirements include being a Filipino citizen 
                or a legal resident, and passing any necessary background checks. 
                Eligibility verification protects both the applicant and the 
                general public by ensuring that only qualified individuals can 
                lega`lly possess firearms.

            <p>
                Gather all necessary documents required for submission to the 
                Philippine National Police (PNP) Firearms and Explosives Office (FEO). 
                Commonly required documents include a valid government-issued ID, proof 
                of residence, certificate of training on firearms safety, and other 
                supporting documents depending on the type of license being applied for. 
                Meticulous preparation at this stage reduces delays during application

            <h1>Step 3: Complete Firearms Safety Training</h1>
            <p>
                Applicants must complete a firearms safety and proficiency course accredited 
                by the PNP. This training covers safe handling, operation, storage, and 
                transportation of firearms. Proof of course completion, usually in the form 
                of a certificate, must be submitted along with the application. This step 
                ensures applicants understand their legal and moral responsibilities as 
                firearm owners.

                Submit your complete application to the FEO, along with all supporting documents 
                and training certificates. The FEO will conduct a thorough background check, 
                including verification of criminal history, mental health, and any records that 
                could disqualify the applicant. The process ensures that firearms are not issued 
                to individuals who may pose a danger to themselves or the public.

            <h1>Step 5: Pay Required Fees</h1>
            <p>
                Application fees, which vary depending on the type of license and firearm, must be 
                paid as part of the submission process. Receipts must be kept for verification. 
                Timely payment of fees ensures that your application moves smoothly through the

        <div class="steps-to-apply">
            <h1>Step 6: Inspection and Evaluation</h1>
            <p>
                Some applications may require an inspection of the premises where the firearm will 
                be kept. This is to ensure that safe storage measures are in place, such as gun safes 
                or secure storage cabinets. The FEO may also evaluate the applicant’s understanding 
                of firearm safety and proper handling procedures during this stage.

                Once all checks, documentation, and inspections are complete, and the application is 
                approved, the license to own and possess firearms (LTOPF) will be issued. This license 
                is valid for a specific period, after which renewal is necessary. License holders are 
                responsible for maintaining compliance with all RA 10591 provisions and any other relevant 
                regulations.
